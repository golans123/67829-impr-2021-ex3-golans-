Q1
What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value? What do we try
to control on? about the array coeff

A1
each level of the pyramid has a different frequency domain. the bigger the
picture, the higher the frequencies (according to the laplacian pyramid
definition). so the parameter we are trying to control is the dominance of each
frequency domain.
