Q3
What happens (and why does this happen) to the result blending from section 4
image when:
Blending is performed with a varying number of pyramid levels
(max_levels = 1,2,3,4,5,...).

A3
the higher the number of pyramid levels, the longer/smoother the transition
are from one picture to another is.
This happens since it creates a gaussian pyramid that also distinguished low
frequencies, and thus a laplacian pyramid that shows edges of even smaller
scales. thus, there gentle stitching also in low frequencies and the result is
a smoother blending.
