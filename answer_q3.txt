Q3
What happens (and why does this happen) to the result blending from section 4 image when:
Blending is performed with a varying number of pyramid levels (max_levels = 1,2,3,4,5,...).

A3
the higher the number of levels of the pyramid, the longer/smoother the transition are from one picture to another is.
This happens since it creates more laplacian pyramid pictures, this means that each level
represents a smaller/narrower frequency domain, which its higher frequencies. Thus each stitching is between
two pictures with greater frequency similarity and the stitching is smoother.
