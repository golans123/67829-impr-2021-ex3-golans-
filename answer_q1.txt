Q1
What does it mean to multiply each level in a different value? What do we try to control on?
about the array coeff

A1
each level of the pyramid has different frequency domain. the bigger the picture,
the higher the frequencies (thanks to laploacian pyramid definition).
so the parameter we are trying to control is the dominance of each frequancy domain.
